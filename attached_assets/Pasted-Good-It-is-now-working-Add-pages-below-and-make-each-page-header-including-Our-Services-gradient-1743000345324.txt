### Admin Products Editor ( Restricted - ONLY on owner/admin dashboard - Create, Edit/Update, Delete)
- Access & Role-Based Permissions:  
  Within the admin/dashboard area, only authenticated users with the role of owner/admin will have access to product management features. This is achieved using role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that sensitive operations are restricted.

- Admin Product Management Features:  
  - Create Product:  
    - A form to add new products. This form will include fields for product image upload, product name, a detailed description, pricing, and any additional metadata (e.g., category, tags).
    - A “Submit” button to add the new product to the database, making it immediately visible on the public products page.
  
  - Edit/Update Product:  
    - Each product listed in the dashboard will have an “Edit” button. Clicking it will open an interface where the owner/admin can update any product details, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
    - Changes are saved with an “Update” button, and modifications are instantly reflected on the public site.
  
  - Delete Product:  
    - An option to remove a product permanently from the listing. A confirmation prompt ensures that deletion is intentional.
    - This helps maintain a clean and up-to-date product catalog.

- User Interface for Product Management:  
  - Dashboard Integration:  
    - The product management functionality will be a dedicated section within the admin dashboard.
    - The layout is similar to the public-facing product cards, but with additional controls (Edit, Delete, Create New Product).
  - Rich Editing Tools:  
    - Incorporate a rich text editor for detailed product descriptions.
    - Drag-and-drop image upload for ease of use.
  - Feedback and Confirmation:  
    - After each operation (create, update, delete), display confirmation messages (toast notifications) to inform the admin of successful actions.

### Admin Orders/Products Dashboard
On owner/admin dashboard there should be
    - Orders placed and stage/progress of completion (stage/progress is a dropdown list)
    - Patient's requests with complete information and stage/progress

---

### Workflow and Implementation
- Backend Integration:  
  - Ensure that your API endpoints (e.g., via Vercel’s serverless functions) support CRUD operations for products.
  - Use authentication tokens and role-checking in API requests to verify that only owner/admin users can perform create, update, or delete actions.

- State Management:  
  - Use Redux or Context API to manage product data on the front-end.
  - Implement optimistic updates to show changes immediately in the UI upon admin actions.

- Security Considerations:  
  - Validate input data on both client and server sides.
  - Protect routes in the admin dashboard with role-based route guards.

Update “Quick Links” in footer by adding “Products” and “Blogs” links immediately below “Services”. Then add the “Donate” link at the bottom, below “Contact” this donate should be a button and must be animated to have my primary colors as a gradient and should be blinking like a heartbeat.

These 2: “Products” and “Blogs” must also be on navbar immediately after “Services”.

My social media icons in the footer should also be neumorphic as they are in the contact page “Connect With Us”.

 How is that “Live Chat” working? I want it to be connected to the admin dashboard. Other admins can see if a client’s message has been responded to… one client to many admins “one-to-many”

###############
How are the admins getting patients input on the “appointment” page, on their admin dashboards? {
Book an Appointment
Schedule a Consultation with Our Specialists} Ensure that the data is going and displaying on a dashboard with good UI
