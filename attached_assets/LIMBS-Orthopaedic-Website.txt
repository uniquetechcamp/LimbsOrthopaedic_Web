PART 2: (INSTRUCTIONS, CODE SAMPLES, AND DEPLOYMENT)
—————————————————————————


A. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Auth and Role Management:
 Enhance your authentication logic (in useAuth.ts and authSlice.ts) to include user roles (e.g., role: "patient" | "doctor" | "owner").

* Protected Routes:
 In AppRoutes.tsx, create a higher-order component (HOC) or use route guards to check if the user is logged in and has the proper role before granting access to pages like:

   * PatientRecords
   * TreatmentStages
   * DashboardHome
   * DoctorManagement
Example:

 tsx
CopyEdit
// ProtectedRoute.tsx
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';


type ProtectedRouteProps = {
  children: JSX.Element;
  requiredRole?: string;
};


export const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, requiredRole }: ProtectedRouteProps) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (!user) {
    // Not logged in, redirect to login
    return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  }
  
  if (requiredRole && user.role !== requiredRole) {
    // Logged in but does not have the required role
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }
  
  return children;
};
   * Usage in Routing:

 tsx
CopyEdit
// AppRoutes.tsx
import { ProtectedRoute } from './ProtectedRoute';


<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
  // ... other public routes
  <Route
    path="/dashboard"
    element={
      <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="doctor">
        <DashboardHome />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    }
  />
  <Route
    path="/dashboard/patient-records"
    element={
      <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="owner">
        <PatientRecords />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    }
  />
  <Route
    path="/dashboard/treatment-stages"
    element={
      <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="doctor">
        <TreatmentStages />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    }
  />
  // ... additional protected routes
</Routes>
   * ________________


B. Patient Information and Treatment Stages
   * PatientRecords Page:
 This page will list all patients (or a filtered list based on the doctor or owner’s access). Each patient entry could display a summary, such as:

      * Name, Age, Contact Info
      * Current Treatment Stage (e.g., initial consultation, prosthetic fitting, follow-up care)
      * Quick stats (e.g., number of appointments, progress notes)
      * TreatmentStages Page:
 When selecting a patient, this page provides a detailed timeline of treatment stages, including:

         * Initial Consultation: Notes and recommendations.
         * Prosthetic/Orthotic Fitting: Images, measurements, and adjustments.
         * Follow-Up: Scheduled appointments, progress reports, and feedback.
         * Next Steps: Upcoming treatments, additional services, or referrals.
         * Backend Integration:
 Ensure that your API (handled via api.ts) and Redux slice (patientsSlice.ts) support CRUD operations for managing patient records and treatment stages securely.

________________


C. Push to GitHub & Deployment on Vercel
GitHub Personal Access Token: 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
            * Serverless Functions:
 If your app uses any server-side logic (e.g., secure API endpoints for patient data), consider Vercel’s Serverless Functions to handle these requests.

            * Environment Variables:
 Configure your environment variables in Vercel’s dashboard (e.g., API keys, database URIs).

            * Optimized Routing:
 Ensure client-side routing (React Router) is supported by setting up proper rewrites in your vercel.json if needed.

________________


By integrating these admin-focused pages and role-based protections, hospital owners and doctors can securely view and manage detailed patient information and treatment stages while keeping patient data confidential. Let me know if you need further details or examples on any of these aspects

3. Security and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                           * Only authorized users (doctors, hospital owners) can access patient records and treatment history.
                           * General visitors can only see public pages (Home, About, Services, Contact).
                           * Login System required for admin access.
Example:
                           * If a doctor logs in, they can view patient records and update treatment progress.
                           * If an unauthorized person tries to access a patient's details, they get redirected to an "Unauthorized Access" page.

4. Deployment & Optimization
                           * Host the website on Vercel or Netlify for fast performance.
                           * Use SEO optimization to improve visibility on Google (e.g., "Best prosthetic limb specialists in Nairobi").
                           * Ensure mobile responsiveness for easy access on all devices.
